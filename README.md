# ðŸš— Car Price Predictor

This is a Machine Learning project that predicts the **price of used cars** based on input features like:

- Brand
- Mileage
- Engine Capacity
- Transmission Type
- Seating Capacity
- Maximum Power

The model is trained using **Linear Regression** and deployed as a web app using **Streamlit**.

## ðŸ§  Workflow

1. **Data Collection** â€“ Gathered car dataset with prices and features.
2. **Preprocessing** â€“ Handled missing and duplicate records.
3. **Feature Selection** â€“ Kept only relevant columns.
4. **Model Training** â€“ Used 80% training and 20% testing data.
5. **Deployment** â€“ Created a simple UI using Streamlit to predict prices.
